## Preparing for the Lab

### About
This repo contains code for various Hands-On Labs (HOL) at Linux Academy.  Each HOL will be contained in its own branch and are outlined below.  Each HOL is designed to be independently consumable and to reinforce learning from the course.

Each lab will help to increase your knowledge in developing Alexa skills with the intent ro prepare you for the certification exam.  They can be used independently but for best results the course is also recommended.

### Prerequisites

There are two options for working through the labs:
1. Linux Academy Virtual Machines which are hosted on AWS
2. Your local machine

Differences are noted below.  The advantage of using the Linux Academy Virtual Machine is that many pieces are setup for you so you can focus on learning the concepts and skills necessary for the exam. And as always, you do nto accrue a charge on your personal AWS account.

In order to use these labs you will need a machine with: 
- node (>= v8)
- git (>= 2.14.5)
- ask-cli (>= 1.7.10)

If using the Linux Academy provided machines, these will be pre-loaded for you.  

You will also need an [Amazon Developer Account](https://developer.amazon.com?&sc_category=Owned&sc_channel=RD&sc_campaign=Evangelism2018&sc_publisher=github&sc_content=Content&sc_detail=hello-world-nodejs-V2_CLI-1&sc_funnel=Convert&sc_country=WW&sc_medium=Owned_RD_Evangelism2018_github_Content_hello-world-nodejs-V2_CLI-1_Convert_WW_beginnersdevs&sc_segment=beginnersdevs).  Please use the link provided to sign up for one if you do not already have one.

If you are using your local machine you will also need an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/).  Please use the link to sign up if you do not have an account.

Familiarity with AWS is necessary.  It is recommended that you have teh skills or take teh training in these courses:
- [AWS IAM](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/180)
- [AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate Level](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/228)
- [AWS Certified Developer - Associate Level](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/181)

- [AWS Security Essential](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/181)
- [Lambda Deep Dive](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/204)


## Branches (Labs)

Each lab is self-contained in a branch. This allows you to use the labs independently.  Instructions will be provided in each lab for cloning the particular branch (lab) to the machine you are using.

**If you want to use this repo for your own changes and experimentation, please clone the repo to your account and make changes as necessary to clone your copy of the repo to the machine you are using.**

I look forward to working with you helping you pass the Alexa Certified Skill Builder Specialty Exam.
